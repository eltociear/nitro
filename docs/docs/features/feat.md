title: Nitro Features 
---

Nitro wraps llama.cpp so it has as many features as llama.cpp offers. But the llama.cpp is a research base repo so we decide to improve it for production ready repo.

With that in mind, Nitro provides advancement features:

- 1-click install.
- Runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
- Compatible with arm64, x86, and NVIDIA GPUs.
- OpenAI compatibility.
- HTTP interface with no bindings needed.
- Runs as a separate process, not interfering with main app processes.
- Multi-threaded server supporting concurrent users.
- No hardware dedendencies.
- Ships as a small binary (~3mb compressed on average).
