OPTIONAL: You can run Nitro on a different port like 5000 instead of 3928 by running it manually in terminal

./nitro 1 127.0.0.1 5000 ([thread_num] [host] [port])
thread_num : the number of thread that nitro webserver needs to have
host : host value normally 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0
port : the port that nitro got deployed onto
